## GAD - Generalized Anxiety Disorder
This project is about the development of an ontology to assist mental health professionals in the diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults. The main objective is to structure knowledge about GAD in a graphical and organized manner, based on the DSM-5 and the MSD Manual. This will allow psychologists, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals to support their analyses better.

Before starting the development or use of this ontology, it is recommended to carefully read the ORSD (Ontology Requirements Specification Document), which defines the requirements and guidelines for creating and implementing the ontology. The ORSD is essential for understanding the purpose and how the ontology was developed.

Suppose the user wishes to conduct query tests on the OWL file. In that case, there is a PDF file titled "Queries_SPARQL" that already contains examples of ready-made queries, facilitating the exploration of the ontology and the execution of practical tests.
